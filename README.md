# Frontend developer and User Experience specialist

I'm a frontend developer with more than ten years of experience among marketing agencies, services, and digital products. I also have a strong background when it comes to user experience and animation-driven interfaces.

I've worked within a variety of projects, like institutional websites, e-commerces, design-focused state-of-the-art webpages, A/B testing, financial products, and e-mail marketing.
